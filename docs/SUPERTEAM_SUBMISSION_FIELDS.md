## Field 1: Live Platform URL
*(Required — "A working, public link to your live platform URL")*

```
https://coldstar.dev/colosseum
```

---

## Field 2: GitHub Repository
*(Required — "Repository pushed to FairScale's GitHub organization with README and setup instructions")*

```
https://github.com/ExpertVagabond/coldstar-colosseum
```

**NOTE:** The listing says the repo must be "pushed to FairScale's GitHub organization." Check if FairScale has a GitHub org you need to fork into (e.g., github.com/fairscale-xyz/coldstar-colosseum). If so, fork the repo there first and submit that URL instead. If unclear, ask in their Telegram support channel before submitting.

```
[TO BE ADDED — Record 5-min Loom/YouTube first]
```

**Recording checklist for the demo video:**
1. Show the Coldstar CLI launching (main.py TUI menu)
2. Walk through a FairScore reputation lookup (menu option F)
3. Demo a Tier 1 HARD BLOCK — attempt to send to a low-reputation address
4. Demo a Tier 2 SOFT WARNING with confirmation prompt
5. Demo a Tier 3+ GREEN LIGHT clean send flow
6. Show Jupiter swap with deployer address screening
7. Show the vault dashboard with reputation badges
8. Briefly show the air-gap QR code flow (create unsigned TX -> sign offline -> broadcast)
9. End with GitHub repo + coldstar.dev/colosseum link

- **Target Audience:** Solana power users, DAOs managing treasuries, AI agent operators
- **Revenue Model:** Freemium CLI (free) + Premium API tier for institutional users + DAO treasury management fees
- **User Acquisition:** Solana developer community -> crypto security forums -> hardware wallet users
  - First 100: Colosseum hackathon community + FairScale ecosystem
  - First 1,000: X/Twitter launch campaign + Solana Discord seeding
  - First 10,000: Integration partnerships with Jupiter, Squads, Meteora
- **Demand Evidence:** Only cold wallet on any chain with on-chain reputation gating

@buildcoldstar — Solo Founder & Full-Stack Developer

GitHub: @ExpertVagabond
Twitter/X: @buildcoldstar
Email: MatthewKarstenConnects@gmail.com
Built Coldstar as a solo developer during the 10-day Colosseum Agent Hackathon sprint (Project #62, submitted as Agent #127). Deep Solana ecosystem experience building with Jupiter, Pyth, Anchor, SPL tokens, and MCP agent integrations. Polyglot developer shipping production code in Python, TypeScript, Rust, Ruby, and Go. Track record of rapid execution — Coldstar went from zero to live deployment with FairScore integration, Jupiter swaps, Pyth price feeds, QR-code air-gap signing, and a Rich TUI dashboard in under two weeks.
```

## Field 8: FairScore Integration Description
*(Required — "Brief description of FairScore integration and why it matters")*

```
Coldstar integrates FairScore as a CORE GATING MECHANISM for every outbound transaction — not a badge or afterthought. Every transfer queries the FairScale API (GET /score?wallet=<address> with fairkey auth header) BEFORE the transaction can cross the air gap for offline signing.

WHY IT MATTERS: Cold wallets protect private keys but are completely blind to who you're sending to. Once a transaction crosses the air gap and gets signed offline, it's irreversible. FairScore at the air-gap checkpoint is uniquely impactful — it's the last line of defense before an irrevocable signature.

6 INTEGRATION POINTS:

1. TRANSACTION GATING (Primary): Bronze tier (FairScore <20) = HARD BLOCK, transaction rejected before QR code generation. Silver tier (20-39) = SOFT WARNING requiring explicit user confirmation. Gold/Platinum/Diamond = green light. This runs on every outbound transfer in create_unsigned_transaction().

2. DYNAMIC TRANSFER LIMITS: Transfer caps scale with recipient reputation tier — Bronze: 0 SOL (blocked), Silver: 10 SOL, Gold: 100 SOL, Platinum: 500 SOL, Diamond: unlimited. Enforced at transaction preparation.

3. DAO GOVERNANCE WEIGHTING: Multi-sig proposal vote weight is influenced by voter's FairScore tier. Tier 5 gets 2x multiplier, Tier 1 cannot vote. Prevents Sybil attacks on governance.

4. JUPITER SWAP SCREENING: Token deployer/contract addresses checked for reputation before creating swap transactions. Low-tier token contracts trigger warnings to protect against honeypot tokens and rug pulls.

5. VAULT DASHBOARD BADGES: Reputation tier badges displayed alongside portfolio balances in the Rich TUI dashboard. Color-coded (red/yellow/green/cyan/magenta) with score and tier info for all displayed addresses.

6. MCP AGENT GATES: AI agents get transaction autonomy proportional to their FairScore — Tier 3+ can execute, Tier 1-2 blocked. Prevents compromised agents from sending to malicious addresses.

IMPLEMENTATION:
- src/fairscore_integration.py — FairScoreClient class (341 lines): API client, tier mapping, risk assessment, transaction blocking, transfer limits, reputation badges, tier legend display
- config.py — FAIRSCORE_API_URL, FAIRSCORE_API_KEY, FAIRSCORE_ENABLED, FAIRSCORE_MIN_TIER configuration
- main.py — 7 integration points: wallet status display, create_unsigned_transaction() gating, check_fairscore_reputation() lookup, cleanup
- docs/fairscale-openapi.yaml — Full OpenAPI 3.0 spec for /score, /fairScore, /walletScore endpoints

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Real FairScale API at https://api2.fairscale.xyz with fairkey header authentication
- Maps API string tiers (bronze/silver/gold/platinum) to internal 1-5 numeric system
- Score-based fallback when string tier is missing (0-19=Tier1, 20-39=Tier2, 40-59=Tier3, 60-79=Tier4, 80-100=Tier5)
- 5-minute TTL response cache to minimize API calls while keeping data fresh
- Graceful degradation: when API is unreachable, falls back to configurable default tier (default: Tier 3)
- Air-gap device NEVER contacts FairScore — all checks happen on the online device before QR code generation, preserving complete offline isolation

This is the ONLY cold wallet on Solana (or any chain) that integrates on-chain reputation into the transaction signing flow.

## Field 9: User Count / Traction Evidence
*(Required — "Active marketing, user testimonials, waitlists, partnerships, user metrics")*

```
Coldstar launched as Colosseum Agent Hackathon Project #62 (submitted as Agent #127) and is live at coldstar.dev. The project has a public GitHub repository at github.com/ExpertVagabond/coldstar-colosseum.

As a cold wallet CLI tool targeting security-conscious Solana users, traction is measured in code quality, ecosystem integration depth, and community engagement rather than traditional DAU metrics:

- 1,400+ lines of production Python across 13 source modules
- 5 protocol integrations: Jupiter (swaps), Pyth (price feeds), FairScale (reputation), Squads (multi-sig), Meteora (liquidity)
- Full air-gap signing flow with QR code transfer between online and offline devices
- Rich TUI dashboard with real-time portfolio, price feeds, and reputation badges
- OpenAPI 3.0 documentation for FairScale API integration
- Active on X/Twitter: @buildcoldstar with Solana ecosystem engagement

User acquisition strategy: Solana developer community first (hackathon exposure) -> crypto security forums and cold wallet communities -> institutional DAO treasury managers needing reputation-gated signing.
```

1. GitHub repository insights (traffic, clones, stars)
