## Tweet 1: The Hook

What if your cold wallet could tell you if an address is trustworthy BEFORE you sign the transaction?

Not after. Not during. **Before.**

That's exactly what we built with @FairScore integration in @ColdstarWallet 🧵

## Tweet 2: The Problem

Cold wallets are secure but **blind**.

They protect your private keys but give ZERO context about who you're sending to:
• Is this address a known scammer?
• Is this token contract a honeypot?
• Is this a fresh wallet or battle-tested?

You're signing blind. Until now. 🔐

## Tweet 3: Enter FairScore

@FairScore is a reputation scoring system for Solana addresses.

Think of it like a credit score, but for wallets:

🔴 Tier 1: UNTRUSTED (scammers, flagged addresses)
🟡 Tier 2: LOW TRUST (new, minimal history)
🟢 Tier 3: TRUSTED (established, clean record)
🔵 Tier 4: HIGH TRUST (verified protocols)
🟣 Tier 5: EXCELLENT (top-tier reputation)

## Tweet 4: The Genius Part

FairScore checks happen on your **online device** BEFORE the transaction crosses the air-gap.

Your cold wallet (offline device) never needs internet. Never compromises isolation.

It only signs transactions that already passed reputation screening.

Security + Intelligence. Finally. 🧠

## Tweet 5: Tier 1 HARD BLOCK Demo

Trying to send to a known scam address?

**NOPE.** 🚫

Coldstar + FairScore will hard-block the transaction before it even generates a QR code.

You can't accidentally send to a scammer. The system won't let you.

## Tweet 6: Tier 2 SOFT WARNING Demo

New address with minimal history?

You'll get a **warning** ⚠️, but you can still proceed if you choose.

Default limit: 10 SOL for Tier 2 addresses.

Coldstar doesn't make decisions for you. It gives you the data to decide wisely.

## Tweet 7: Tier 3-5 GREEN LIGHT Demo

Sending to a verified protocol or high-reputation address?

**Smooth sailing.** ✅

Tier 3+: No warnings, no friction, just fast secure transactions.

Tier 4/5 get elevated limits (500 SOL / unlimited) because reputation = trust.

## Tweet 8: The Agent Economy Angle

AI agents are coming to crypto.

They'll need to transact autonomously. But how do you trust an agent's decisions?

With @FairScore gates:
• Agents can only send to Tier 3+ addresses
• DAO votes weighted by sender reputation
• Jupiter swaps screened for honeypot tokens

Safety rails for the agent economy. 🤖

**Online device:**

• Block/Warn/Allow logic
• Generate unsigned TX QR

**Air-gap device:**
• Scan QR
• Sign offline
• Return signed QR

**Online device:**

## Alternative Hooks (Test Variants)

If Tweet 1 underperforms, try these variants:

**Hook A (Shocking stat):**
> "85% of crypto phishing happens because users don't know who they're sending to.
>
> Cold wallets can't help. They're offline.
>
> Until @FairScore integration changed the game. Here's how 🧵"

**Hook B (Relatable pain):**
> "You've double-checked the address.
> You've triple-checked the amount.
> You hit send.
>
> Then realize it's a scammer.
>
> @ColdstarWallet + @FairScore would've blocked it. Here's the tech 🧵"

**Hook C (Provocative):**
> "Cold wallets are overrated.
>
> They protect your keys but not your judgment.
>
> We fixed that. Let me show you how reputation scoring changes everything 🧵"
