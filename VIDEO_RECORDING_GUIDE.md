## 🎤 Narration Tips:

### Voice Recording:
- **Pace**: Moderate (not too fast)
- **Tone**: Professional but enthusiastic
- **Enunciation**: Clear pronunciation of technical terms
- **Pauses**: Brief pauses between sections

### Script Reading:
- Read through 3 times BEFORE recording
- Mark breathing points in script
- Record in segments (can edit together later)
- Option: Record narration separately, overlay on video

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- ❌ Speaking too fast (slow down!)
- ❌ Monotone delivery (show enthusiasm!)
- ❌ "Um", "uh", filler words (pause instead)
- ❌ Background noise (test audio first)

## 🎥 Recording Options:

### Option 1: All-in-One Recording
**Tools**: OBS Studio
**Method**: Record screen + narration simultaneously
**Pros**: Faster, natural flow
**Cons**: Harder to fix mistakes

### Option 2: Separate Recording + Editing
**Tools**: QuickTime (screen) + Audacity (audio) + iMovie (editing)
**Method**: Record screen footage, record narration separately, combine
**Pros**: Better quality, easier to fix
**Cons**: More time-consuming

### Option 3: Automated Alternative (If No Time)
**Tools**: Screenshots + Online video maker
**Method**: Use our generated screenshots + text overlays
**Pros**: No narration needed
**Cons**: Less engaging

**Solution**: Increase mic gain, or normalize audio in post

**Problem**: Video file too large (>2GB)
**Solution**: Re-export with lower bitrate (1500 Kbps)

**Problem**: Terminal text hard to read
**Solution**: Increase font size to 18-20pt, use high contrast theme

**Problem**: Recording stutters/lags
**Solution**: Close other apps, lower recording quality slightly

**Problem**: Don't have time for video
**Solution**: Use our screenshot gallery as "visual demo" and focus on written documentation
